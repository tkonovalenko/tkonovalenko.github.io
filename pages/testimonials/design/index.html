            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny's worth.

              "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free Intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.

              "Before Joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
              needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
              learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my devetopent experience. It certainly helped me land a
              job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend!"
